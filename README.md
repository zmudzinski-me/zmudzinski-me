## Hello there 👋

My name is Łukasz and I'm a `Python` Engineer from Poland 🇵🇱.

Over the last 10+ years, I've been creating software for various companies and startups. I am coding in Python, mostly using Django, FastAPI and other backend-related packages. In my free time, I extend my knowledge of the language's internals and learn new best coding practices.

I am currently working as a `Senior Python Developer` at [Infermedica](https://infermedica.com).

- Be sure to check out our [Careers](https://infermedica.com/careers) page, so we can work on `#digitalhealth` together 🥰.

**Things I can help you with:**

- [x] Writing code for your Python project,
- [x] Leading technical teams,
- [x] Consulting architecture and cloud solutions,
- [ ] Latte art for your daily coffee.

✅ Although my current job takes my full professional attention, you are free to contact me in the following topics:

- `digital health` `humanity` `animal welfare` `general science` `green energy` `agriculture`

🛑 The following topics will be dismantled and exterminated (I won't reply):

- `gambling` `hazard` `adult` `seo` `ecommerce`

May the Force be with you.
